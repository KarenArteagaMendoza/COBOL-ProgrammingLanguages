## üìú Course Overview

The course provides a practical introduction to COBOL, one of the longest-standing and still-used programming languages in the world. You'll learn how to:

- Understand COBOL's structure and syntax
- Write procedural and object-based programs
- Handle data using structured types
- Perform file I/O and business-style processing
- Explore concepts like loops, conditions, and modular programming
- Apply COBOL in real-world scenarios, including polynomial algebra

---

## üìù Contents

- `Polynomials/polynomial.cob` ‚Äî A module implementing various polynomial operations in COBOL
- `Polynomials/polynomials.cob` ‚Äî A sample main program demonstrating polynomial addition, composition, differentiation, etc.
- `code/` ‚Äî Folder for practice scripts, examples, and exercises
- `docs/` ‚Äî Slides, guide and exam
- `README.md` ‚Äî This documentation file

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements

- GnuCOBOL 3.1 or newer
- Terminal or environment capable of compiling COBOL programs

---

## üíª Installation Instructions

### On macOS (via Homebrew)

```bash
brew install gnu-cobol
```

Then verify:

```bash
cobc -v
```

### On Debian/Ubuntu Linux

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install open-cobol
```

To verify:

```bash
cobc -v
```

> Note: Some distros may have an older version of GnuCOBOL. For the latest release, consider compiling it from source: https://gnucobol.sourceforge.io/

---

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Example

To compile the polynomial module and main program:

```bash
cobc -free -m Polynomial/polynomial.cob
cobc -free -x Polynomial/polynomials.cob Polynomial/polynomial.cob
```

Then run:

```bash
./polynomials
```

## ü®† Learning Goals

By the end of this course, you'll be able to:

- Write complete COBOL programs from scratch
- Understand divisions, data definitions, and procedural logic
- Perform common tasks like reading/writing files and arithmetic processing
- Translate real-world problems into structured COBOL code
- Appreciate COBOL's continued relevance in finance, banking, and enterprise systems
